A small .NET based application that displays a list of the editable fields inside of PDF files.  I used this application as a way to test out pdf files that were created with editable fields for a small project at work.

You will need to use the itextsharp library in order to run this application.  You can download the itextsharp library here:  http://itextsharp.com.  Once downloaded, you'll need to add a reference to the itextsharp.dll to your project.
